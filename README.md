### Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.



These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly stable, in addition to restricting in-bound access to the network.


Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the JumpBox and system Internal Network.
Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that monitors specific files or locations and ships them to either Elasticsearch or Logsearch
Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that monitors metrics from the operating system and ships them to either Elasticsearch or Logsearch


The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| Web 1    | Container| 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web 2    | Container| 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| Elk      | Kibana   | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the JumpBox machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
47.229.158.173

Machines within the network can only be accessed by JumpBox.
My public IP

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2    |
| Web 1    | No                  | 10.1.0.4             |
| Web 2    | No                  | 10.1.0.4             |
| Elk      | No                  | 10.1.0.4             |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
Ansible is free and open source and extremely powerful
You don't need any other third party tools other than docker to run, which makes this an efficient and somewhat lightweight tool.
Ansible has a lot of very good documentation and is really easy to set up, needing very little programming knowledge when it comes to Playbooks.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
Install docker.io
Install python3pip
Increase virtual memory
Download and install dockers
Have the dockers run on boot

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.




### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
Web 1: 10.0.0.5
Web 2: 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Filebeat
Metricbeat These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
Filebeat collects - collects data about files or file locations
Metricbeat collects - collects metric data about the operating system, such as hardware usage


### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook.yml file to Ansible Control Module.
- Update the hosts file to includeâ€¦ 
cd /etc/ansible
$ cat > hosts
[webservers]
  10.0.0.5 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
  10.0.0.6 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
  10.0.0.7 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
[elk]
  10.1.0.4 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

- Run the playbook, and navigate to Kibana filebeat and Metricbeat modules to check that the installation worked as expected.
cd /etc/ansible
  $ ansible-playbook install-elk.yml
  $ ansible-playbook install_metricbeat_and_filebeat-playbook.yml
Playbook for Filebeat and Metricbeat are also here: filebeat
To update a specific machine on a playbook, you have to edit the hosts file to include the local IP addresses of the machines you want. You can also add a group name by putting the name of the group in brackets above the IPs, as shown as above. After that is done, in your playbook file where it calls for a host
